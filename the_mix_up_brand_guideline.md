## The mix up Event Titles

Pattern:
`the mix up [edition] | [date]`

Examples:
- `the mix up vol. 13 | 1 sep 2024`
- `the mix up on a boat | 14 jul 2024`

- Use this pattern consistently throughout all social media, RA posting, chat groups, links etc.
- The _edition_ qualifier either specifies the volume number, e.g. "vol. 11", or a descriptor for unusual events, e.g. "meet up".
- Use and increase the volume number for regular events.
- An edition is not referred to as a "version". Use the "vol." abbreviation, not "v".
- The _date_ should be a complete date in a "day month year" format. Use a three letter abbreviation for months without the trailing period, e.g. "apr" for April.
- Do not rearrange this pattern.

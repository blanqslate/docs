Blanq Slate Offboarding Proposal

>>Purpose
There are a few scenarios in which members leave the group. The purpose of this document is to outline those specific scenarios and the process through which we offboard roles and responsibilities.

Scenarios
Inactivity

In our meeting, we described a threshold for unacceptable inactivity as being ~3 months. Inactivity is subjective, but could come in the form of:

Not showing up to events
No contributions in ideation for the group
No input on discord

“We’ll know it when we see it”.

Procedure 
After 3 months of inactivity, warn member via DM
Proceed to remove member if inactivity continues (see Procedure “Kicking” / Banning)
“Kicking” / Banning

The reasons for kicking and banning may vary widely. But the important thing here is that a group consensus reflects that “we don’t want to work with this person”.

Procedure 
Topic arises with reason for banning
Vote is opened
If unanimous, member is removed
Responsibilities are handed off to active members
Admin access is removed in Discord
Access to socials and other logins are removed
Member graduates to Alumni status

Temporary Voluntary Leave
This roughly translates to “member wants to take a break”.

Procedure 
Member announces temporary leave
Length of leave
Reason if desired / applicable
Member enumerates responsibilities both short term and long term
Active members become responsible for the enumerated responsibilities
Member decides how he/she/they want to manage access (e.g. Discord, IG)
Eg, “please remove me from admin status in Discord”
Or eg, “I’ll just mute Discord channels myself, but may still look at them from time to time”
Member decides if returning or not within their stated timeline
If extending leave, procedure loops back to #1
If leaving for good, procedure extends to the one outlined in “Permanent Voluntary Leave”

Permanent Voluntary Leave
This equates to someone “leaving for good”.

Procedure 
Member announces permanent leave
Reason if desired / applicable
Member enumerates responsibilities both short term and long term
Active members become responsible for the enumerated responsibilities
Access is removed
Admin access is removed in Discord
Access to socials and other logins are removed
Member graduates to Alumni status

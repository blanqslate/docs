# 10000ft details

1. Stick to the mission: 
> share, encourage, and inspire with creativity... celebrate art in all forms, and foster a community to create, move, shake, disrupt, destroy, and do it all over again

2. Think about messaging how you want it to be when you attend. So many events are just just ‘here is the lineup, here is the venue and date, here is some art’ whereas event concepts are very attractive to people and really grow a community. This doesn't **have** to be a theme, but it should probably be a **vibe** at the very least.

3. Cherish and do not compromise on artistic & creative integrity

4. Agree with your collaborators on the concrete goals for an event to avoid later confusion and scrambling. Some examples:
    * If an event is **supposed** to have a particular theme, e.g. to stick to a particular music genre, talk with collaborators on some guest DJs who would actually fit that genre before inviting those people
    * If an event is **supposed** to contribute to some sort of social cause (e.g. "let's make sure we platform only people from underrepresented groups"), then establish that ahead of time and get group buy-in as opposed to retrofitting an event that was planned without this specifically in mind

5. Plan an event you'd actually want to attend!

# Make a plan, and write it down

# Ideal timeline
An ideal, smooth event should probably meet these goals:

## 2 months out

* Lock in venue, including rental and bar minimum terms and timelines. May also include logistics and staffing considerations like ticketing and security. Examples with made up details and dates:
    * `Water Bar in Hayes Valley on 8/27 -- they take the bar, we take the door, they pay for the bouncer`
    * `4096 Van Ness on 2/29 -- $2000 venue rental fee, $3000 bar minimum, we are responsible for security and ticket sales`

* Have a back-of-the-envelope budget estimate, for example:
    * `We expect ~100 people with an avg of $10 per ticket, and we expect each of them to buy 2x $5 drinks -- $1000 net from door, $1000 net at bar`

* Contractors (e.g., promo) should be informed of the compensation structure including how/when/what they're getting paid
* Establish a concrete plan for ticket sales
* Have a working event concept (not necessarily a final theme, but definitely some idea) and begin working on promotional materials
* Construct a vague plan for promotion

## 1 month out

* Lock in all other required staffing and logistics, like bouncers
* Have a **finalized** lineup with all primary performers fully committed. 
    * If this is a music event, this means that musicians are committed, but secondary features like in-room performing artists may not yet be locked in
* Have most of the graphics for promotion finalized
* Begin promoting the event on social media
* Have a complete list of equipment we need for the event (may vary depending on event concept and venue)

## 1 week out
* Have a concrete plan for controlling access to and from the venue
    * e.g. "only one actual entrance / exit, one security guard, ins and outs are allowed, and folks get a stamp on the top of their right hand when we scan their ticket"
* Understand **exactly** what equipment is required to bring to the venue day-of. This includes:
    * Decor
    * Extension cables
    * Performance hardware (DJ gear, poledancing poles, artist easels, etc)

...more to come

## Day-of
* Have one point of contact between us and venue + contractors that are involved in day-of logistics (e.g., bouncer)
* Follow SOP of the venue and conduct ourselves professionally
* Everyone arrives on time and supports each others' sets as much as possible
* Take photos/videos for retro social media posts
* Support through your own social media posts (stories) during event as possible
* Keep in mind feedback for the future (what went well, what opportunities were missed, what we can continue to do)
* There should be ample help / hands on deck for clean up. Nobody wants to be a custodian for everyone else's mess.

## Post-event
* Thank venue + collaborators
* Make sure contractors have been paid
* Have a retro at the next monthly meeting (what went well, what could we improve, what should we continue to do)

# Miscellaneous tidbits

* Building a community is really hard -- but, being able to reliably host a hundred people and give them all a happy experience is not a thing that every group can do
* Invest in deco that is easy to set up and doesn’t require maintenance… Buy fake plants instead of real ones, for instance
* It's better to throw a party in a room that's just a bit too small than one that's too large

# Open questions

* When do we and do we not need security?
* When should contractors expect a payout? How do we pay them? (some people may not have Venmo)

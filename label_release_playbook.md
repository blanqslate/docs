# 10000ft details

1. Stick to the mission: 
> share, encourage, and inspire with creativity... celebrate art in all forms, and foster a community to create, move, shake, disrupt, destroy, and do it all over again

2. Start with a due date! Producers are lazy
    * A good due date is at least a month before your target release date, but may be more than that.

# Ideal timeline

TODO

# Raw plan from BSR002

The plan:
1. Solicit submissions from anyone in the discord via a Google Form, due date Aug 15 (end of that night, midnight PST)
1. All 4 original members of the 1st comp should listen to every submission within that week
1. Aug 22, those 4 members meet up (irl or over VC is fine) to discuss every submission
1. Members are allowed to approve or disapprove of a submission and must provide at least some feedback
1. Submissions are accepted if and only if approval is unanimous
    * Possible rare scenario: if a submission is really good but has something small they need to fix, we can reach out to that person directly with specific feedback and ask them to resubmit within the next 3 days.

IMO the target size should be 3-7 tracks, and the standards should be very creatively high. No genre requirement

***

feedback mandatory for every submission

possible outcomes for each sub: 

1. any veto counts
1. need feedback
1. pass

kasper to remind people every week over discord
